# Flipkart Product Categorization

This project aims to predict the category of a product typically found on e-commerce sites like Flipkart. The Machine Learning models have been trained on a Flipkart e-commerce dataset to enhance product categorization, improve search efficiency, and enhance user experience.

### Tasks Undertaken
### 1. Data Visualization:

- Used libraries like seaborn, matplotlib to visualize the dataset and uncover hidden parameters.
- Generated Word Clouds to identify and remove irrelevant words from the corpus.

### 2. Data Preparation:

- Focused on using the root of the Product Category Tree as the primary label for classification.
- Cleaned, preprocessed, and resampled the data to balance the dataset.

### 3. Category Analysis:

#### Detailed analysis and visualization led to the identification of key categories:

- Clothing
- Footwear
- Pens & Stationery
- Bags, Wallets & Belts
- Home Decor & Festive Needs
- Automotive
- Tools & Hardware
- Baby Care
- Mobiles & Accessories
- Toys & School Supplies
- Jewellery
- Kitchen & Dining
- Computers
- Watches
## Usage

 ### Run the Jupyter Notebooks:

- Navigate to the Notebooks folder.
- Open and run the notebooks in the specified order - for EDA, training, and testing.

### Dataset Preparation:

- Prepare the dataset by following the instructions in the Dataset Preparation section of the notebooks.

### Text Normalization:
 
- Normalize the text data as outlined in the Text Normalization section to ensure clean and consistent input for the models.

### Model Training and Evaluation:

- Train the models using the Train Validation Split and TF-IDF Vectorization sections.
- Evaluate the models and tune hyperparameters as needed.

### Predict on Test Data:

- Use the trained models to predict the categories of the test data and analyze the results.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the process of predicting product categories based on descriptions using advanced text classification techniques. The model's performance indicates its potential for real-world applications in e-commerce platforms to enhance product search and categorization.
